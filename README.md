## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### üèÄ Key Code Snippets

#### 1. Basketball Court Creation with Markings
This is the heart of our court construction, creating the wooden floor and all required white lines:

```javascript
function createBasketballCourt() {
  // Court floor - brown wooden color with 2:1 proportions
  const courtLength = 30;
  const courtWidth = 15;
  const courtGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(courtLength, 0.2, courtWidth);
  const courtMaterial = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({ 
    color: 0xc68642,  // Brown wood color
    shininess: 50
  });
  const court = new THREE.Mesh(courtGeometry, courtMaterial);
  court.receiveShadow = true;
  court.position.y = -0.1;
  scene.add(court);
  
  // Create court lines (white)
  const lineMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffffff });
  const lineHeight = 0.05;
  
  // Center line
  const centerLineGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(0.2, lineHeight, courtWidth);
  const centerLine = new THREE.Mesh(centerLineGeometry, lineMaterial);
  centerLine.position.set(0, lineHeight/2, 0);
  scene.add(centerLine);
  
  // Center circle
  const centerCircleGeometry = new THREE.RingGeometry(2.8, 3, 32);
  const centerCircleMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ 
    color: 0xffffff, 
    side: THREE.DoubleSide,
    transparent: true,
    opacity: 0.8
  });
  const centerCircle = new THREE.Mesh(centerCircleGeometry, centerCircleMaterial);
  centerCircle.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2;
  centerCircle.position.y = 0.02;
  scene.add(centerCircle);
}
```

#### 2. Complete Basketball Hoop Assembly
This function creates a regulation basketball hoop with all required components:

```javascript
function createBasketballHoop(xPosition, direction) {
  const hoopGroup = new THREE.Group();
  
  // Support pole (behind backboard)
  const poleGeometry = new THREE.CylinderGeometry(0.3, 0.3, 12);
  const poleMaterial = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({ color: 0x666666 });
  const pole = new THREE.Mesh(poleGeometry, poleMaterial);
  pole.position.set(xPosition + (direction * 3), 6, 0);
  pole.castShadow = true;
  hoopGroup.add(pole);
  
  // Backboard (white, partially transparent)
  const backboardGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(0.2, 3.5, 2.5);
  const backboardMaterial = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({ 
    color: 0xffffff,
    transparent: true,
    opacity: 0.8,
    side: THREE.DoubleSide
  });
  const backboard = new THREE.Mesh(backboardGeometry, backboardMaterial);
  backboard.position.set(xPosition, 10, 0);
  backboard.castShadow = true;
  hoopGroup.add(backboard);
  
  // Rim (orange)
  const rimGeometry = new THREE.TorusGeometry(0.9, 0.05, 8, 32);
  const rimMaterial = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({ color: 0xff6600 });
  const rim = new THREE.Mesh(rimGeometry, rimMaterial);
  rim.position.set(xPosition - (direction * 0.6), 10, 0);
  rim.rotation.x = Math.PI / 2;
  rim.castShadow = true;
  hoopGroup.add(rim);
  
  // Net (created with line segments)
  createNet(xPosition - (direction * 0.6), 10, hoopGroup);
  
  scene.add(hoopGroup);
}
```

#### 3. Perfect Three-Point Arc Implementation
After multiple iterations, this creates the perfect curved three-point lines:

```javascript
function createThreePointLine(basketX, direction) {
  // Create the arc using ring geometry with proper positioning
  const arcGeometry = new THREE.RingGeometry(5.8, 6.2, 32, 1, -Math.PI/2, Math.PI);
  const arcMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ 
    color: 0xffffff, 
    side: THREE.DoubleSide,
    transparent: true,
    opacity: 0.8
  });
  const arc = new THREE.Mesh(arcGeometry, arcMaterial);
  
  // Position and rotate correctly for basketball court
  arc.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2; // Lay flat on court
  arc.rotation.z = direction > 0 ? Math.PI : 0; // Face correct direction
  
  // Position at basket location, shifted toward baseline
  const baselineOffset = direction * 1.5;
  arc.position.set(basketX + baselineOffset, 0.02, 0);
  
  scene.add(arc);
}
```

### üé® Architecture Highlights

- **Modular Design**: Each component (court, hoops, ball) is created by separate functions
- **Realistic Proportions**: All measurements follow basketball regulation standards
- **Enhanced Lighting**: Professional shadow mapping with 2048x2048 resolution
- **Material Realism**: Proper transparency, shininess, and color values
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient geometry creation and grouped objects

## Controls
- **O Key**: Toggle orbit camera controls on/off
- **Mouse**: When orbit is enabled:
  - Left click + drag: Rotate camera
  - Right click + drag: Pan camera
  - Scroll wheel: Zoom in/out

## Additional Features Implemented
- Enhanced shadow quality with soft shadows
- Realistic court proportions and measurements
- Professional UI design with branded styling
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Comprehensive net geometry with multiple line segments
- Proper material properties for realistic appearance

## üèüÔ∏è Bonus Features - Stadium Environment
- **Stadium Bleachers**: 8-row bleachers on both sides with 15 seats per row
- **Physical Scoreboard**: 3D scoreboard positioned behind the basket showing HOME/AWAY scores
- **Support Structures**: Realistic pole and arm support for the scoreboard
- **LED Lighting**: Decorative lights around the scoreboard perimeter
- **Realistic Materials**: Alternating blue seat colors and proper stadium atmosphere

## Known Issues/Limitations
- This is the infrastructure version (HW05) - interactive ball physics will be added in HW06
- Net segments are static (physics-based net movement will be implemented later)
- No collision detection yet (planned for HW06)

## External Assets Used
- Three.js r128 (CDN)
- OrbitControls.js (included in project)
- No external textures or models used - all geometry created programmatically

## Future Development (HW06)
The current infrastructure is designed to support the following features in the next assignment:
- Interactive basketball shooting mechanics
- Physics-based ball movement and collision detection
- Scoring system with basket detection
- Ball rotation animations
- Additional camera control modes
- Enhanced UI interactions
